    "text": "Bayesian Statistics\nI’ve long believed that learning statistics–as a student or teacher–can be more intuitive and meaningful if the first steps are taken on the ‘Bayesian road’. In my experience, this approach not only makes key concepts easier to grasp, but also lays the groundwork for understanding frequentist ideas more naturally down the line. That said, applying Bayesian methods in practice–despite major recent advances in computational tools like Stan–remains a real challenge, especially in a teaching context. Integral techniques, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, need to be taught and applied by students in order to fully understand the concepts … there is no way around that. Yet: difficulties!"

    "text": "Where the Package fits in\nThat’s exactly where this package comes in: The motivation for creating yet another R package in this space arose from my experience teaching Bayesian statistics and conducting research with Stan-based models. I frequently found myself writing and reusing custom functions to bridge gaps between several popular tools: Richard McElreath’s excellent rethinking package (which accompanies his highly recommended book Statistical Rethinking and had been a huge inspiration for this undertaking), the R6-based CmdStanR ecosystem, and the rstanarm interface (featured in Regression and Other Stories by Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari–a book full of engaging teaching ideas)."

    "text": "Born in the class room\nWhat started as a small collection of convenience functions–just some scripts and helper functions for extracting, transforming, and visualizing parameter draws–grew into something bigger. Whether the draws came from rstan, CmdStanR, or rethinking, I needed a consistent, interface-agnostic way to work with them. Simulating from prior and posterior predictive distributions and teaching students how to do it by themselves? That is a challenge on its own right. But one special persistent challenge remained a nag: how to compare draw distributions across models cleanly and intuitively? Why should it take so many coercions, castings, and package cross-calls just to show students the implications of the statistical models at hand? I wanted to cut through the technical noise and keep the focus on understanding–not mechanics. That need became especially clear when teaching: explaining complex Stan models became far more intuitive when broken into smaller, modular pieces. Why not build models incrementally, step by step, each part highlighting a key idea? So I began building functionality for modular Stan code generation; making it easier to construct, teach, and communicate models in a structured yet flexible way."

    "section": "Live Diagnostics",
    "text": "Live Diagnostics\nAll of the above essentially addresses setting up models or analyzing results obtained from Monte Carlo samplers. But what about the sampling process itself? If you´re a Bayesian modeler–and maybe you´ve experienced this firsthand–you know the feeling: the situation of waiting patiently for the sampler to finish, only to find the sampling having gotten off the rails early on. In this regard, this meme is spot on (found in this nice read).\n\n\n\nBayesian modelling: Rather straightforward to grasp, but challenging to apply.\n\n\nAnd as Bayesian modelers we are also trained to always perform diagnostic checks through visualizations of sampling trajectories (often referred to as traceplots), after sampling is done. So why not check traceplots while sampling is taking place? Through that, one can quickly identify pathological problems, realize what might be wrong with the model, and abort the sampling, thus saving valuable time. The bayesutils offers this simple solution, although currently sampling through CmdStanR is supported only. In this solution, the log-files of the sampler are read and saved trajectories are visualized as traceplots, repeatedly updated in the process. You can quickly see if your sampler is healthy or spookily exploring the outer realms of infinity.\nThis simple idea has greatly impacted my personal workflow in research. For example I had to apply this functionality relentlessly in developing models for inferring chemical turnover rates based on UV-vis data obtained from aging blood samples. In the development process we tested many different modelling approaches, all requiring significant computational resources. And you maybe guessed it; some model ideas required refinements. Or to put it differently: These models had structural defects that made them slow and unfeasible to sample properly. By visualizing the sampler as it was producing unusable draws, we were discovering these defects early on. Having this kind of immediate feedback not only saved time and resources–it greatly shaped how we approached model development and debugging."

So if you are one of those working directly with CmdStanR, rstanarm, or custom Stan code, you might find some implemented ideas helpful to integrate into your workflows. After all, I have to say that it is still WIP and far from a finished product. Yet I considered it might be of value for some and, thus, worthwhile sharing after all."

In all this, emphasis is placed on acknowledging uncertainty and respecting statistical assumptions. I’ll be involved in lecturing as well as leading seminars and exercises. The course will begin in the upcoming winter semester, and it’ll be an engaging challenge for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Forensics V (Models and Simulations in Forensics)\n\n\n\nThis course focuses on connecting forensic hypotheses with available evidence, applying computational modeling techniques, and using simulation-based methods for forensic inference. I taught the course as the seminar instructor.\n\n\n\n\n\nCausal Inference and Generative Modelling\n\n\n\nIn this course, I focus on teaching how anyone capable of coding a simulation of a process of interest can use it to drive statistical inferences based on analogous real-world data. Students learn how to apply graphical causal models to refine and adjust these statistical models–and, more importantly, they come to understand that data alone cannot reveal its underlying causes."
